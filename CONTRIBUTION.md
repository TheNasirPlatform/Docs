The Nasir Platform project is mostly educational project, which student of KNTU could enhance their skills, communicate, share, and build useful softwares and systems.

### Road-map of Projects
1. idea
2. plan
3. implementation specifics
now we will explain each one briefly.
##### 1. Idea
each project starts with a raw ideas. there are no restrictions on practicallity of this ideas and there is no cencorship for them. this ideas could be saved to the Docs/Ideas repo,thorough different ways:
1. pull reqs on Docs/Ideas.md file
2. open issues in docs repo
3. contact main contributers in github/email/telegram

- fully duplicate ideas are not accepted
- if you have an improvement or dissagreement with an idea which is already saved in the ideas.md file, you can open an issues and discuss it there
##### 2. Plan
so you saw an idea on Docs/Idea.md and like one and then want to implement it,
in this part you should define a detailed explanation of how a software system should behave in order to satisfy the requirements of the Idea. in other words this would be the blueprint of the project generated from an Idea and waiting to be implemented.

you can request your plans to be added to Docs/L1||L2 by:
1. pull request a new files like : Docs/L2/DataGatheringSystem.md
2. send your plan to main contributers through email/telegram in a pdf/md format

- fully duplicated Ideas are not accepted
- again , if you have a problem with a submitted plan you can open an issue on Doc repo about it 
- each idea could have different plans

##### 3. Implementation specifics
this is the final place , after selecting a plan for an idea of a project then, developers are expected to give their details of implementing the plan like: what tools and programming language they use? what frameworks they want to work with? their databases? and many other stuff.

they also should indicate their project in this docs:
- a README.md file to give an overview of their implementation and plan
- CONTRIBUTION.md file to specify how people can work on their project
- LICENCE.md 
the above docs are mandatory but below docs are optional:
- INSTALLATION unique
- USAGE s
- CHAINGELOG
- API Docs
- TESTING
- ARCHITECTURE/DEVELOPER
- EXAMPLES/TUTORIALS
- FAQ
- ROADMAP
- GOVERNANCE

after an implementation application from a developer is accepted then a new repo in NasirPlaform would be created and the developer would be the main contributer of this project.
