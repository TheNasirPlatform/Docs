The Nasir Platform project is primarily an educational initiative where students of KNTU can enhance their skills, collaborate, share ideas, and build useful software and systems.

### Roadmap of Projects

1. Idea
2. Plan
3. Implementation Specifics

Each of these steps will be briefly explained below.

#### 1. Idea

Every project begins with raw ideas. There are no restrictions on the practicality of these ideas, and no censorship is imposed. Ideas can be saved to the `Docs/Ideas` repository in various ways:

1. Submitting a pull request to update the `Docs/Ideas.md` file
2. Opening an issue in the Docs repository
3. Contacting the main contributors via GitHub, email, or Telegram

- Fully duplicate ideas are not accepted.
- If you have suggestions or disagreements with an idea already saved in the `Ideas.md` file, you can open an issue to discuss it.

#### 2. Plan

Once you find an idea in `Docs/Ideas.md` that interests you and you wish to implement, the next step is to define a detailed plan. This plan should describe how the software system should behave to meet the requirements of the idea. Essentially, it is the blueprint of the project, evolving from an idea into a concrete plan awaiting implementation.

You can submit your plans to be added to `Docs/L1` or `Docs/L2` by:

1. Submitting a pull request with a new file, e.g., `Docs/L2/DataGatheringSystem.md`
2. Sending your plan to the main contributors via email/Telegram in PDF/MD format

- Fully duplicated plans are not accepted.
- If you have concerns or suggestions regarding a submitted plan, you can open an issue in the Docs repository.
- Each idea can have multiple plans.

#### 3. Implementation Specifics

This is the final phase. After selecting a plan for an idea, developers are expected to provide detailed information about how they will implement the plan. This includes:

- Tools and programming languages to be used
- Frameworks they intend to work with
- Databases
- Other relevant specifics

Developers should document their project in the following files:

- `README.md`: Overview of the implementation and plan
- `CONTRIBUTION.md`: How others can contribute to the project
- `LICENSE.md`: Licensing details

The following files are optional but encouraged:

- `INSTALLATION.md`
- `USAGE.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `API_DOCS.md`
- `TESTING.md`
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` or `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`
- `EXAMPLES.md` or `TUTORIALS.md`
- `FAQ.md`
- `ROADMAP.md`
- `GOVERNANCE.md`

Once the implementation plan is accepted, a new repository within the Nasir Platform will be created, and the developer will become the main contributor to the project.
