this would be template for any IDEA to be transformed into a PLAN in future
this one is simple, just tell your ideas, there is no need to explain or  think about technical challenges.

the only thing that you should be aware of is that it is apprecieated if your IDEAs are expressed completely? and clearly in a way that if someone reads your IDEA they would get it in first place and please prevent any ambigiuty.

although all the things above are judged subjectively and can not be forced by law so, its on you to express your ideas clearly.

read THE_NASIR_PLATFORM IDEA to get a hint of the whole Nasir Project. 
you can express one of the modules in THE_NASIR_PLATFORM for start or reads other IDEAs .
