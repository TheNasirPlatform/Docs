i would like to call my IDEA "SNAPP SHARE"; an application that helps students of KNTU to share a ride with are other students. this app would be somewhat a systematic way of using "اسنپ اشتراکی خواجه نصیر " telegram group.

but there are some pros of using this app:
1. peoples privacy is more okeyed?
2. it is easier to understand which rides are available 
3. now you can define if you want to share a ride with only womans, only mans, mixed
4. you can define the number of peoples
5. peoples security is now more guaranteed and 

- it would be great if it shows the overall price and my share 
- it would be great if it has a simple UI/UX 
- it would be great if it doesn't share my ride with others
